TIY Spring 2017 Front End Assignment

What does it do?
----------------
**Explorer Mode**

Using a fresh clone of the webpack-starter
Create a document reader app, that allows users to read a document and mark that document as read.
Use a checkbox to allow a user to mark a document as read
When the user checks the checkbox, it should become checked AND they should be prompted to confirm whether they truly read the document (perhaps with a modal)
If they confirm, the box should remain checked AND become disabled.
If they cancel, the box should go back to being unchecked.
This app should be using multiple react components.
This app should be using the Redux architecture.
Reducer/Actions

**Adventurer Mode**

All documents in your app should be stored in backendless and if the documents are read or not should be kept up to date.
Create an interface for a user to view a list of all documents they must read.
The interface should show the user whether the documents are read, but not allow the user to change their read status. They must view the actual document to change its status.

**Epic Mode**

Don't allow a user to mark a document as read unless they have SEEN all the content of the document.
Format the documents so that each doc's body can be stored on the server as html, and could have multiple paragraphs within it.
